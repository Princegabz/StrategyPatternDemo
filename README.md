. You
are required to do the following:
• Create a console application which will allow data sets to be entered
as individual objects. This requires that you create a class called
DataSet.
• Each DataSet should have o A name o Contain a list of integers.
o Have the ability to sort the list of integers using a specific sorting
behavior.
o Have the ability to output the list of integers using a specific
output behavior.
o The sorting and output behavior should be changeable during
run-time.
• Your program needs to include at least 4 data sets. You may hard
code the entries for the data sets, i.e. you do not need to ask the user
to enter the values for the data set.
• You are required to include at least 2 sorting algorithms as Sorting
behaviours.
• You are required to include 2 output behaviours as Output behaviours.
The 2 output behaviours should
be o Horizontal: e.g.
1,2,3,4,5,6 o Vertical: e.g.
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
• Your program needs to demonstrate both Sorting and Output
behaviours as well as show that it is possible to substitute behaviours
during run-time
